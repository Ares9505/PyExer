1a) Create a class representing a time interval;
the class should implement its own method for addition, subtraction on time interval class objects;
the class should implement its own method for multiplication of time interval class objects by an integer-type value;
the __init__ method should be based on keywords to allow accurate and convenient object initialization, but limit it to hours, minutes, and seconds parameters;
the __str__ method should return an HH:MM:SS string, where HH represents hours, MM represents minutes and SS represents the seconds attributes of the time interval object;
check the argument type, and in case of a mismatch, raise a TypeError exception.

1b) Extend the class implementation prepared in the previous lab to support the addition and subtraction of integers to time interval objects;
to add an integer to a time interval object means to add seconds;
to subtract an integer from a time interval object means to remove seconds.

2) Your task is to build a multifunction device (MFD) class consisting of methods responsible for document scanning, printing, and sending via fax.
The methods are delivered by the following classes:
scan(), delivered by the Scanner class;
print(), delivered by the Printer class;
send() and print(), delivered by the Fax class.

Each method should print a message indicating its purpose and origin, like:
'print() method from Printer class'
'send() method from Fax class'

create an MFD_SPF class ('SPF' means 'Scanner', 'Printer', 'Fax'), then instantiate it;
create an MFD_SFP class ('SFP' means 'Scanner', 'Fax', 'Printer'), then instantiate it;
on each object call the methods: scan(), print(), send();
observe the output differences. Was the Printer class utilized each time?
